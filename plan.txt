Data scraping plan:
- daily get all events 10 days in the future
- before live:
	- scrape for odds changes every minute
	- will i get limited?
		- add logging for status code.
- during live:
	- subscribe to websockets and get live odds changes.
		- ** could i just do this all the time? when not live?
		- might avoid limiting issues

x Update the way that sportsbooks process specific market/sports combinations.
Make markets more dynamic, different period types, first half + second half + ... these might have the same ids but should be treated as different markets.
- Design a way to keep track of market periods, need to make seperate markets.
- Honestly probably need a better unified way to keep track of selection names based on market kind.
	- unify every market kind except for team names which can be pretty easily fuzzyd.

- Probably want to focus on live odds next as that presents the biggest opportunity.

- very future:
	- want to focus on bot executed trades
	- human like behavior (anti-bot detection patterns)

DB updates:
x create history of odds updates!
	x history table: that includes timestamp, sb_selection_id, odds
x store the original sportsbook names of things to verify fuzzy string matching if needed.

- get rid of unnecessary tables like sports + sbs
